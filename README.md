### Overview
Blockchains are a public record of value transactions that have taken place.

These transactions often contain sensitive data such as personally identifiable information - so how does the blockchain secure against this information leaking into the wrong hands?

In this project, you will get a chance to create your own blockchain “identity” and see how it is used to solve this issue.

Your blockchain “identity” is an encrypted private-public key pair that generates wallet address which allows you to anonymously interact with information on the blockchain while still allowing others to verify your data. In this project, you will generate a private-public key pair with your wallet client, create a new wallet address, and learn how to use it to verify your identity.
