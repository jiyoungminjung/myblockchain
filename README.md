## [Project: Managing you Blockchain identity](https://github.com/linked0/myblockchain/tree/master/ud-blockchain-proj2)

### Overview
Blockchains are a public record of value transactions that have taken place.

These transactions often contain sensitive data such as personally identifiable information - so how does the blockchain secure against this information leaking into the wrong hands?

In this project, you will get a chance to create your own blockchain “identity” and see how it is used to solve this issue.

Your blockchain “identity” is an encrypted private-public key pair that generates wallet address which allows you to anonymously interact with information on the blockchain while still allowing others to verify your data. In this project, you will generate a private-public key pair with your wallet client, create a new wallet address, and learn how to use it to verify your identity.

### Build This Project
To complete this project, follow the steps below. Then submit the required information outlined in the Prepare for Submission section.

Project Steps
Step 1: Navigate to Electrum.org to download and install your bitcoin wallet.

Step 2: Walk through the wallet interface and find your wallet address.

Step 3: Navigate to our web application and use your wallet address to generate a message.

Step 4: Use your wallet to sign the message.

Step 5: Validate message signature with our web application.

Step 6: Using your text editor, document your wallet address, message, and validated message signature.

Step 7: Submit your project document

## [Project: Private Blockchain](https://github.com/linked0/myblockchain/tree/master/ud-blockchain-proj3)
Building Your Own Private Blockchain

In this course, you learned all about blockchain and transaction data models as well as the differences between public and private blockchains. In this project you will put this knowledge to practice by creating your own private blockchain. However, this current model has some flaws in saving, persisting, and validating data. Your challenge in this project is to refactor your private blockchain to securely handle this information.
